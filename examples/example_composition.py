This example script demonstrates the use of BurnMan's Composition class.

*Uses:*

* :class:`burnman.Composition`

*Demonstrates:*

* Creating an instance of the Composition class with a molar
  or weight composition
* Printing weight, molar, atomic compositions
* Renormalizing compositions
* Modifying the independent set of components
* Modifying compositions by adding and removing components

    # FeO + m O -> f Fe(57) + (1-f)/2 Fe2O3

Experimental observations:
Volume: 19.0287 +/- 0.1903 m^3/mol
Temperature: 1073.15 +/- 10.0 K

Pressure estimated using the Decker equation of state:
21.6417 GPa

Pressure with propagated uncertainty
estimated using the Decker equation of state:
21.6417 +/- 1.0010 GPa
PVT correlation matrix:
[[ 1.         -0.99955588  0.02979992]
 [-0.99955588  1.          0.        ]
 [ 0.02979992  0.          1.        ]]
The uncertainties and correlation matrix only take into account 
the uncertainties in the measured volume and temperature, 
not the uncertainties in the calibrated equation of state.

Consistency checks:
Volume: 19.0287 +/- 0.1903 m^3/mol
Temperature: 1073.15 +/- 10.0000 K
V-T correlation: -0.000000

Result of conversion from Decker calibration to Decker calibration:
21.6417 +/- 1.0010 GPa
(This should be the same as the pressures above)

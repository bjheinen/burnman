Experimental observations:
Volume: 19.0328 +/- 0.1903 m^3/mol
Temperature: 1073.15 +/- 10.0 K

Pressure estimated using the Decker equation of state:
21.7180 GPa

Pressure with propagated uncertainty
estimated using the Decker equation of state:
21.7180 +/- 1.0245 GPa
PVT correlation matrix:
[[ 1.         -0.99957603  0.02911621]
 [-0.99957603  1.          0.        ]
 [ 0.02911621  0.          1.        ]]
The uncertainties and correlation matrix only take into account 
the uncertainties in the measured volume and temperature, 
not the uncertainties in the calibrated equation of state.

Consistency checks:
Volume: 19.0328 +/- 0.1903 m^3/mol
Temperature: 1073.15 +/- 10.0000 K
V-T correlation: 0.000000

Result of conversion from Decker calibration to Decker calibration:
21.7180 +/- 1.0245 GPa
(This should be the same as the pressures above)
